# Claude Vibes - Master Template Project

## Project Context
This is the master template for Claude Vibes - a framework for rapid MVP development with AI-powered automation.

## Framework Mode
Mode: fast-track  # Options: fast-track (default), traditional, hybrid
Started: [timestamp]

## Fast Track Status
- [ ] MVP defined
- [ ] Stack selected  
- [ ] First feature implemented
- [ ] Deployed

## Hybrid Mode Configuration (if using hybrid)
# Stage Configuration:
# - Stage 0: [traditional/fast-track]
# - Stage 1: [traditional/fast-track]
# - Stage 2: [traditional/fast-track]
# - Stage 3: [traditional/fast-track]
# - Stage 4: [traditional/fast-track]
# - Stage 5: [traditional/fast-track]
# - Stage 6: [traditional/fast-track]

## Project Type
- Framework: Claude Vibes v2.0
- Mode: Fast-Track (AI-Powered)
- Language: TBD (selected via /fast-stack)
- Architecture: TBD (generated as needed)
- Domain: TBD (defined via /fast-define)

## Development Standards
- Speed: MVP first, polish later
- Testing: Test core features only initially  
- Quality: Refactor after validation
- Documentation: Generate as you go
- Git: Auto-commit with clear messages

## Fast Track Commands (5 minutes to code!)
- `/turbo-mvp "idea"` - All-in-one MVP starter
- `/fast-define` - Quick problem definition
- `/fast-stack` - Instant stack selection
- `/fast-implement` - Direct to coding
- `/project-status` - Check progress

## Traditional Commands (comprehensive planning)
Enable with: `/setup-framework --traditional`
- `/analyze-problem` - Stage 1: Problem analysis
- `/gather-requirements` - Stage 2: Requirements
- `/design-architecture` - Stage 3: Architecture
- `/select-components` - Stage 4: Components
- `/design-detailed` - Stage 5: Detailed design
- `/plan-implementation` - Stage 6: Sprint planning

## Hybrid Mode Commands (mix and match)
Enable with: `/setup-framework --hybrid`
- `/hybrid-mode` - Configure which stages use which approach
- `/use-traditional-for` - Set stages to use traditional
- `/use-fast-track-for` - Set stages to use fast-track
- `/transition-to-fast-track` - Switch from traditional to fast
- `/formalize-with-traditional` - Generate docs from code
