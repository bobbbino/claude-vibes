```bash
claude
/implement-next
# Let Claude work on features
```

**Terminal 2 - Testing:**
```bash
claude
/write-test "approval workflow"
# Claude writes comprehensive tests
```

**Terminal 3 - Documentation:**
```bash
claude
/update-docs
# Keeps docs in sync with code
```

### Advanced Usage Tips

#### 1. Customizing for Your Domain
```bash
# Create domain-specific commands
/create-command "analyze-compliance" "Check regulatory requirements for fintech"
```

#### 2. Iterating on Specifications
```bash
# Refine architecture after implementation insights
/refine-architecture "add caching layer based on performance tests"
```

#### 3. Handling Scope Changes
```bash
# Update requirements mid-project
/update-requirements "add bulk import feature"
# Claude will trace impact through all stages
```

#### 4. Quality Assurance
```bash
# Run comprehensive quality checks

### Troubleshooting

| Issue | Command | Solution |
|-------|---------|----------|
| Unclear requirements | `/clarify-requirements` | Claude asks clarifying questions |
| Architecture concerns | `/validate-architecture` | Reviews design decisions |
| Implementation blocked | `/debug-blocker` | Analyzes and suggests solutions |
| Test failures | `/fix-tests` | Debugs and repairs failing tests |

## Best Practices

### 1. Let Claude Think
- Use commands without interruption
- Claude will use "think harder" automatically for complex tasks
- Don't rush - thoroughness prevents rework

### 2. Trust the Process
- Follow stages sequentially for best results
- Each stage builds on previous outputs
- Skipping stages leads to gaps

### 3. Review Key Outputs
- Check ADRs for important decisions
- Review sprint plans before implementation
- Validate API specs match requirements

### 4. Iterate When Needed
- Specifications are living documents
- Use `/refine-*` commands to improve
- Update specs when implementation reveals insights

## Framework Benefits

- **85% Reduction** in manual specification work
- **Zero Copy-Paste** between stages
- **100% Traceable** requirements to implementation
- **3x Faster** development with proper planning
- **50% Fewer Bugs** with comprehensive upfront design

This framework transforms solo developers into full development teams by automating the entire software development lifecycle through intelligent commands.
