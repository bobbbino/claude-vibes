## üéØ What is Claude Vibes?

Claude Vibes is an AI-powered development framework that offers two modes:
- **Fast-Track Mode (Default)**: Go from idea to working code in 5 minutes
- **Traditional Mode**: Comprehensive 7-stage workflow for enterprise projects

### Why Claude Vibes?

#### Fast-Track Mode Benefits:
- **5 Minutes to Code** - Start building immediately
- **95% Faster** than traditional planning approaches
- **AI Parallel Processing** - Documentation generated while you code
- **Zero Decision Paralysis** - Smart defaults for everything
- **Rapid Validation** - Ship and get feedback in hours, not weeks

#### Traditional Mode Benefits:
- **85% Reduction** in manual specification work
- **100% Traceable** requirements to implementation
- **50% Fewer Bugs** through comprehensive upfront design
- **Perfect for** large teams and regulated industries

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code) installed
- Git initialized in your project directory
- Basic familiarity with command-line interfaces

### Fast-Track Installation (5 Minutes to MVP!)

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/bobbbino/claude-vibes.git
cd claude-vibes
```

2. Start Claude Code:
```bash
claude
```

3. Initialize with Fast-Track mode (default):
```bash
/setup-framework
```

4. Build your MVP:
```bash
/turbo-mvp "your app idea"
# Example: /turbo-mvp "expense tracker with charts"
```

**That's it!** You're coding in 5 minutes. AI handles planning in the background.

### Traditional Installation (For Enterprise Projects)

```bash
/setup-framework --traditional
```

This creates:
- Complete 7-stage specs/ directory structure
- All traditional planning commands
- Comprehensive documentation templates

## üìö How It Works

### Choose Your Mode

```bash
/show-modes  # See detailed comparison of both modes
```

### Fast-Track Mode (Default) - MVP in Minutes

| Command | Purpose | Time |
|---------|---------|------|
| `/turbo-mvp "idea"` | All-in-one MVP starter | 5 min |
| `/fast-define` | Quick problem definition | 2 min |
| `/fast-stack` | Instant stack selection | 1 min |
| `/fast-implement` | Direct to coding | Immediate |

### Traditional Mode - 7-Stage Development Process

| Stage | Command | Purpose |
|-------|---------|---------|
| 0 | `/discuss-problem` | Review and clarify problem statement |
| 1 | `/analyze-problem` | Deep problem analysis & research |
| 2 | `/gather-requirements` | Generate comprehensive requirements |
| 3 | `/design-architecture` | Create system architecture |
| 4 | `/select-components` | Research & select technology stack |
| 5 | `/design-detailed` | Create implementation-ready designs |
| 6 | `/plan-implementation` | Generate sprint plans & tasks |

### Development Commands

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `/implement-next` | Start next task from sprint plan |
| `/write-test` | Create test for current feature |
| `/code-review` | Review recent changes |
| `/update-docs` | Sync documentation with code |
| `/project-status` | Check current progress |

## üéÆ Complete Walkthrough

### Fast-Track: Building an MVP (Default)

```bash
# Total time: 5 minutes to working code!

# 1. Initialize framework
/setup-framework

# 2. Build your MVP with one command
/turbo-mvp "expense tracker with charts and categories"

# You now have:
# ‚úÖ Working API endpoint
# ‚úÖ Basic UI
# ‚úÖ Database schema
# ‚úÖ Test file
# ‚úÖ Deployment config

# 3. Add features incrementally
/fast-implement "user can upload receipts"
/fast-implement "monthly spending report"
/fast-implement "export to CSV"

# 4. Check progress
/project-status
```

### Traditional: Enterprise Project

```bash
# For comprehensive planning:
/setup-framework --traditional

# Then follow the 7-stage process:
/discuss-problem
/analyze-problem
/gather-requirements
/design-architecture
/select-components
/design-detailed
/plan-implementation
/implement-next
```

## üî• Key Features

### 1. Two Development Modes
- **Fast-Track (Default)**: 5-minute MVP development with AI parallel processing
- **Traditional**: Comprehensive 7-stage workflow for enterprise projects
- **Mode Switching**: Change modes anytime without losing work

### 2. AI-Powered Acceleration
- Parallel processing of documentation while you code
- Smart defaults and instant stack selection
- Background generation of tests and requirements
- Intelligent code suggestions based on context

### 3. Language & Technology Agnostic
- Works with any programming language
- Pre-configured stacks for common scenarios
- Adapts to your technology preferences

### 4. MCP Server Integration
- **Context7**: Real-time documentation for 20,000+ libraries
- **Playwright MCP**: Browser automation for web apps
- Automatic configuration during setup

### 5. Quality Assurance Built-In
- Progressive testing (start simple, enhance later)
- Smart test generation
- Automated code review
- Package version verification

## üìã Examples

### Example 1: Fast-Track Todo App (5 minutes)

```bash
# Initialize and build
/setup-framework
/turbo-mvp "todo app with due dates and categories"

# Add features as needed
/fast-implement "mark todo as complete"
/fast-implement "filter by category"
/fast-implement "due date notifications"

# Deploy when ready
/deploy
```

### Example 2: Traditional Enterprise App

```bash
# Initialize with traditional mode
/setup-framework --traditional

# Edit problem statement
# "Build a web-based todo application with user authentication,
#  task management, and real-time collaboration features"

# Work through all 7 stages
/discuss-problem    # Clarifies: "How many users? Mobile support?"
/analyze-problem    # Creates user personas, market research
/gather-requirements # Defines features, APIs, acceptance criteria
/design-architecture # Chooses microservices, React, Node.js
/select-components  # Selects Next.js 14.2.0, PostgreSQL 16
/design-detailed    # Creates database schema, API specs
/plan-implementation # Creates 6 sprints, 47 tasks
/implement-next     # Implements user authentication
```

## üõ°Ô∏è Best Practices

### For Fast-Track Mode
1. **Start Simple**: Use `/turbo-mvp` with a clear, concise idea
2. **Iterate Quickly**: Add features one at a time with `/fast-implement`
3. **Ship Early**: Deploy and get feedback before adding complexity
4. **Trust the Defaults**: AI selects optimal stacks for your use case

### For Traditional Mode
1. **Fill Out Problem Statement Thoroughly**: Include all constraints and preferences
2. **Follow Stages Sequentially**: Each builds on the previous
3. **Review Key Outputs**: Check ADRs and architecture decisions
4. **Validate Package Versions**: Ensure all exist in registries

### For Both Modes
- Let Claude think through complex problems
- Use multiple terminal windows for parallel work
- Review AI-generated documentation
- Switch modes if project scope changes

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Pitfalls

### Fast-Track Mode
1. **Over-Engineering the MVP**
   - Start with one core feature
   - Add complexity only after validation
   
2. **Ignoring AI Suggestions**
   - Trust the pre-configured stacks
   - Customize after MVP is working

### Traditional Mode
1. **Skipping Stages**
   - Each stage builds on previous outputs
   - Missing stages = implementation failures

2. **Using Non-Existent Package Versions**
   - Framework verifies all versions
   - Never assumes GitHub tags = published

### Both Modes
- Fix test failures immediately
- Review generated documentation
- Don't mix modes without switching properly
